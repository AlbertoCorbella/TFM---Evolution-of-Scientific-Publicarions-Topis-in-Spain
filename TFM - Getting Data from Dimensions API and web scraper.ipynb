Here we report that treatment with the oral mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist spironolactone reduces signs of CNV in patients refractory to anti-VEGF treatment. In animal models of wet AMD, pharmacological inhibition of the MR pathway or endothelial-specific deletion of MR inhibits CNV through VEGF-independent mechanisms, in part through upregulation of the extracellular matrix protein decorin. Intravitreal injections of spironolactone-loaded microspheres and systemic delivery lead to similar reductions in CNV. Together, our work suggests MR inhibition as a novel therapeutic option for wet AMD patients unresponsive to anti-VEGF drugs.\" property=\"og:description\"/>]],\n",

The aim of this prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study is to determine the risk factors for mortality in elderly and very elderly critically ill patients with sepsis. RESULTS: A total of 1490 patients with ≥ 65 years of age were included in the study; most of them 1231 (82.6%) had a cardiovascular failure. The mean age (± SD) was 74.5 (± 5.6) years, and 876 (58.8%) were male. The patients were divided into two cohorts: (1) elderly: 65-79 years and (2) very elderly: ≥ 80 years. The overall hospital mortality was 48.8% (n = 727) and was significantly higher in very elderly compared to elderly patients (54.2% vs. 47.4%; p = 0.02). Factors independently associated with mortality were APACHE II score of the disease, patient location at sepsis diagnosis, development of acute kidney injury, and thrombocytopenia in the group of elderly patients. On the other hand, in the group of very elderly patients, predictors of hospital mortality were age, APACHE II score, and prompt adherence of the resuscitation bundle. CONCLUSION: This prospective multicenter study found that patients aged 80 or over had higher hospital mortality compared to patients between 65 and 79 years. Age was found to be an independent risk factor only in the very elderly group, and prompt therapy provided within the first 6 h of resuscitation was associated with a reduction in hospital mortality in the very elderly patients.\" property=\"og:description\"/>]],\n",

Tract length often correlates with transcriptional activity and expansion beyond specific thresholds in certain human proteins is the cause of polyQ disorders. To study the structural basis of the association between tract length, transcriptional activity and disease, we addressed how the conformation of the polyQ tract of the androgen receptor, associated with spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), depends on its length. Here we report that this sequence folds into a helical structure stabilized by unconventional hydrogen bonds between glutamine side chains and main chain carbonyl groups, and that its helicity directly correlates with tract length. These unusual hydrogen bonds are bifurcate with the conventional hydrogen bonds stabilizing α-helices. Our findings suggest a plausible rationale for the association between polyQ tract length and androgen receptor transcriptional activity and have implications for establishing the mechanistic basis of SBMA.\" property=\"og:description\"/>]],\n",

A total of 48 newly weaned piglets were individually weighed (initial body weight (IBW): 6.1 ± 0.16 kg) and randomly allocated to 3 dietary treatments (4 boxes as replicates/treatment and 4 animals/box). BSF larva meal was included at increasing levels (0% [BSF0], 5% [BSF5] and 10% [BSF10]) in isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets formulated for two feeding phases: I (from d 1 to d 23) and II (from d 24 to d 61). The weight gain (WG), average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were calculated for each feeding phase and for the whole trial. The haematochemical parameters and nutrient digestibility of the piglets were also evaluated. A total of 3 piglets per box were slaughtered on d 61 and the slaughtered piglets were submitted to morphometric investigations and histopathological examinations. Results: No overall significant differences were observed for growth performance (P &gt; 0.05), except for the ADFI of phase II, which showed a linear response to increasing BSF meal levels (P &lt; 0.05, maximum for the BSF10 group). Dietary BSF meal inclusion did not significantly influence the blood profile, except as far as monocytes and neutrophils are concerned, and these showed a linear and quadratic response, respectively, to increasing BSF meal levels (P &lt; 0.05, maximum for the BSF10 and BSF5 groups, respectively). On the other hand, the nutrient digestibility, gut morphology and histological features were not affected by dietary BSF meal inclusion (P &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: The obtained results show that a partially defatted BSF larva meal can be used as a feed ingredient in diets for weaned piglets without negatively affecting their growth performance, nutrient digestibility, blood profile, gut morphology or histological features.\" property=\"og:description\"/>]]]"
